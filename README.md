# Module Workshop (2017)

This is the material for a workshop about JavaScript module systems.

There are HTML slides in `slides/index.html`, and notes to go along
with them in `slides/notes.txt`. The exercises are grouped by 'year'
under the `20??` directories.

You can run `install.sh` to pre-download the NPM dependencies for the
exercises, in case the internet at the workshop is flaky.
